** .Net Core XAML Designer Extensibility **
The link below explains the new "surface isolation architecture" for .Net Core designer extensibility
for adding designer extensibility to UWP and WPF controls that target .Net Core.
The new architecture uses a .designtools.dll file extension (rather than the old .design.dll file extension).
