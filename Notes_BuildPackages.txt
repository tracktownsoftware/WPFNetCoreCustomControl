To create packages:
1) Open developer command prompt window for VS2019
2) In the developer command prompt window make \CustomControlTests\Pack the current directory
3) At command prompt run packAll.bat
4) Four nupkg files should be output to \CustomControlTests\Pack\Packages

Notes on the \CustomControlTests\Pack\pack*.bat files:
- For .Net Core SDK projects the csproj file contains package information and "dotnet pack" is used.
- For .Net Framework projects a nuspec file is in the project folder that contains package information and "nuget.exe pack" is used.
